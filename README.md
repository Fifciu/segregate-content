# README

This repo contains project faciliating my different hobby. This time I decided to choose absolutly different approach and focus on delivering MVP doing job for me, and don't care about code quality (you wouldn't believe how hard it might be, to prevent yourself from refactoring and thinking a lot before writing code!).

I chosen this approach as my free time is highly limited and the project has to do the job, not have beautiful clear code. After I finish, I will decide if I want spend time refactoring, adding new features, or just use it as it is.

Right now it is hard for me to imagine, not refactoring this monster, but we will see...
